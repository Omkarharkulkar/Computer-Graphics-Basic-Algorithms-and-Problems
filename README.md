## Introduction

Computer graphics is an exciting field that deals with the creation, manipulation, and representation of images and visual data using computers. This repository serves as a starting point for beginners and enthusiasts to explore and understand basic computer graphics algorithms and their practical applications.

## Algorithms Implemented

In this repository, you will find the following algorithms implemented:

1. DDA Line Drawing Algorithm
2. Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm
3. Bresenham's Circle Drawing Algorithm
4. Midpoint Circle Drawing Algorithm

## Geometric Structures

We have also implemented basic geometric structures to aid in visualizing the algorithms and projects. The geometric structures include:

- Circle
- Rectangle
- Ellipse
- Line (Dotted, Dashed, Thick, and Thin)
- Simple House

## 2D Translation and Transformation

Understanding translation and transformation is crucial in computer graphics. We have implemented 2D translation and transformation algorithms to demonstrate how objects can be moved, scaled, and rotated on a 2D canvas.

## Fun Projects

Apart from the basic algorithms and structures, we have included some fun and creative projects to showcase the practical applications of computer graphics:

1. Vehicle Locomotion: An animation of a vehicle moving along a predefined path.
2. Clock with Pendulum: An analog clock with a swinging pendulum.
3. Flag Hoisting: A flag hoisting animation with a waving flag.
4. Olympic Symbol: The Olympic rings displayed in a visually appealing manner.

## How to Use

To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the code for a specific algorithm or project.
4. Compile the C++ code using the appropriate compiler command.
5. Execute the compiled executable to visualize the output.
